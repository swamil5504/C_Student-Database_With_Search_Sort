# C_Student-Database_With_Search_Sort

This is a Student Management System implemented in C. It allows you to store and manipulate student records, including their names, roll numbers, and marks. The program provides functionality to accept student details, sort the records using different sorting techniques, and perform a linear search or a binary search to find a specific student based on their roll number.

## Features

Input student details: The program allows you to input student details such as name, roll number, and marks. You can enter the information for multiple students at once.

Sorting techniques: The program provides three different sorting techniques to sort the student records:
    - Insertion Sort: This technique sorts the records in ascending order based on the roll number.
    - Selection Sort: This technique sorts the records in ascending order based on the roll number.
    - Shell Sort: This technique sorts the records in ascending order based on the roll number.

Searching options: The program offers two search options to find specific students:
    1) Linear Search: You can search for a student by their roll number using linear search. It iterates through the records sequentially until it finds a match.
    2) Binary Search: You can search for a student by their roll number using binary search. This technique requires the records to be sorted in ascending order beforehand.
    
Display sorted records: After a sorting operation, the program displays the sorted student records. The sorted records include the student's name, roll number, and marks.

Continuous execution: The program runs in a loop, allowing you to perform multiple sorting and searching operations without restarting it. You can choose different techniques or search for different students in each iteration.

User-friendly interface: The program provides a simple and intuitive command-line interface. It prompts you for input, displays the results, and guides you through the available options.

## Usage

1. When prompted, enter the number of students for which you want to input records.

2. Provide the details for each student, including their name, roll number, and marks.

3. Choose a searching/sorting technique from the available options:
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Shell Sort
    - Linear Search
    - Binary Search

4. Depending on your choice, the program will either sort the student records or search for a specific student.

5. The program will display the sorted student records or the search result.

6. You can repeat the sorting/searching process as many times as desired.

## How to Run

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system (such as GCC).

2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
